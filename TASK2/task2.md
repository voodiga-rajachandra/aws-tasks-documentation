# Project Overview: Real-Time Web Application with User Data
***

**In this project, we will launch an EC2 instance that automatically installs and configures a simple web application using a User Data script. This application will serve a webpage that displays real-time data, such as the current time.**

### Step 1: Create an EC2 Instance with User Data

**Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the **EC2** dashboard**

 **Launch an Instance:**
   - Click on "Launch Instance."
   - Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), such as **Amazon Linux 2**.
   - Select an instance type (e.g., `t2.micro` for the free tier).
   - In the "Configure Instance" step, look for the **User Data** section.
